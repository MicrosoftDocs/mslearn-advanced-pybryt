Because the input lengths needed to accurately measure time complexity can get very high, PyBryt doesn't trace for values inside these contexts; this means that any calls needed to satisfy value annotations must occur **outside** a `check_time_complexity` context, otherwise PyBryt won't see the value in the student's memory footprint."
